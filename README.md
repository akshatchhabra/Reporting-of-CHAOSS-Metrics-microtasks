# Reporting-of-CHAOSS-Metrics-microtasks
The following repository contains the microtasks for the GSoC project: Reporting of CHAOSS Metrics 

    Microtask 1: Produce a listing of the number of new committers per month, and the number of commits for each of them, as a table and as a CSV file. Use the GrimoireLab enriched index for git.

    Microtask 2: Produce a chart showing the distribution of time-to-close (using the corresponding field in the GrimoireLab enriched index for GitHub issues) for issues already closed, and opened during the last six months.

    Microtask 3: Produce a listing of repositories, as a table and as CSV file, with the number of commits authored, issues opened, and pull requests opened, during the last three months, ordered by the total number (commits plus issues plus pull requests).

    Microtask 4: Perform any other analysis you may find interesting, based on GrimoireLab enriched indexes for git and GitHub repositories.
